Install instructions
====================

Requirements
------------

The metadataserver server requires python-flask (>= 0.10.1) and
python-pymongo.

The client code requires a modified version of MetaDataPlayer that is
available from https://github.com/oaubert/metadataplayer
The symbolic links in *static/* to *metadataplayer* and *libs* must be
fixed (or the files must be copied) from the *test/* directory of
*metadataplayer*.

Running
-------

A single option *-d* exists, to run the server in debug mode (with
better error messages and code autoreload).
