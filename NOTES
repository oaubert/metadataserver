* Server
Mongo Collections:
- user (key: login) ["system" user for system annotations ? or a generic metadata/tag?]
- annotation (key: id)
- annotationtype (key: id)
- media (key: id)
- package (key: id/UUID)
- userinfo (login information)
- trace (some activity trace)

Every list operation (annotation, annotation list, etc) can take a
?filter=name:value parameter, that will add a query filter. Possible "name" values are:
user, media, package, type

*/annotation/ -> list of annotations (may be huge?)
*/annotation/{{id}} -> annotation (cinelab format)

/annotationtype/ -> list of annotation types
/annotationtype/{{id}} -> annotation type (cinelab format)

*/user/ -> list of users
*/user/{{id}} -> user data/profile (json: {email: ..., fullname: ..., etc))
*/user/{{id}}/annotation -> annotations created by user id. POST to it to create annotation?
/user/{{id}}/annotationtype -> annotation types created by user id. POST to it to create annotationtype?
/user/{{id}}/package -> packages created by user id
/user/{{id}}/media -> list of medias annotated by user

*/media/ -> list of media
*/media/{{id}} -> media information (json: { url: "", title: "", creator: "", duration: "", ..., "mds:annotation-count": 12 })
/media/{{id}}/annotation -> all annotations linked to media [list]
/media/{{id}}/annotation/user -> all user annotations linked to media [list]
/media/{{id}}/annotation/user/{{id}} -> annotations by user "id" linked to media [list] 
/media/{{id}}/annotation/system -> all system annotations linked to media [list]
/media/{{id}}/packages -> packages referring to /media (list of urls redirecting to packages)

/package/ -> list of packages
/package/{{id}} -> main package information (mainly meta json + mds:annotation = list of URLs that are used to gather annotations)
